Jonathan Tah is suspended for the round-of-16 clash with Denmark, and Antonio Rüdiger has a thigh issue. Suddenly, Germany may go from unchanged XI to wholesale changes in a heartbeat.

[...] No team at Euro 2024 can feel more hard done by than Ukraine, who accrued four points from three games and still got knocked out. They'll head home, yet have to watch Denmark and Slovenia contest the round of 16 -- despite the fact both only managed three points and neither won a game.\\n\\nAlejandro Moreno wonders who will step up for Croatia now that Luka Modric's generation is nearing their end with the national team.\\n\\n16.
